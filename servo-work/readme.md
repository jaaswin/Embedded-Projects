# Servo Motor Control Using Joystick with OLED Display


## Introduction

Servo motors are widely used in robotics and automation for precise angular control. Joysticks provide an intuitive way to generate analog control signals. The Raspberry Pi Pico, powered by the RP2040 microcontroller, offers ADC channels, PWM hardware, and I2C communication, making it suitable for such control applications.

This project aims to:

* Read joystick movement using ADC
* Generate a corresponding PWM signal
* Control a servo motor angle
* Display joystick and PWM information on an OLED display

## Working Principle

When the joystick is moved, the potentiometer inside it changes resistance, producing a varying voltage. The ADC of the Raspberry Pi Pico converts this voltage into a digital value. This value is scaled into a suitable PWM duty cycle. The PWM signal controls the servo motor position. Simultaneously, the OLED displays the joystick reading, PWM duty cycle, and servo angle in real time.
