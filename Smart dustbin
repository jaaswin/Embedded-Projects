# Smart Dustbin Using ESP32 (MicroPython)

A touch-free waste-disposal system designed using the ESP32 microcontroller, ultrasonic sensing, and a servo-operated lid. The project promotes hygiene by eliminating physical contact with the dustbin and demonstrates core embedded-IoT engineering principles.

## 1. Overview

This project implements a **Smart Dustbin** using an ESP32 running **MicroPython**. The system detects the presence of a hand or object using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) and automatically opens the lid via a PWM-controlled servo motor. After a short delay, the lid closes again.

The project is simple, low-cost, and ideal for learning:

* GPIO control
* PWM for servo
* Distance measurement
* Real-time embedded programming
* MicroPython scripting

## 2. Features

* Fully touchless lid operation
* Accurate distance measurement
* Fast response powered by ESP32
* Safe servo handling using external 5V supply
* Easily customizable threshold & timings
* Low power consumption

---

## 3. Hardware Components

* ESP32 Development Board
* Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
* Servo Motor (SG90/MG90S)
* External 5V power supply for servo
* Jumper wires
* Dustbin with movable lid
* Common ground connection

## 4. Circuit Connections

### Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

| HC-SR04 Pin | ESP32 Pin |
| ----------- | --------- |
| VCC         | 5V        |
| GND         | GND       |
| TRIG        | GPIO 5    |
| ECHO        | GPIO 18   |

### Servo Motor

| Servo Pin | ESP32 Pin   |
| --------- | ----------- |
| VCC       | External 5V |
| GND       | Common GND  |
| Signal    | GPIO 13     |

**Note:**
The servo must not be powered from the ESP32's 5V pin. Use an external 5V source and connect the grounds together.

## 5. Working Principle

1. The ultrasonic sensor emits pulses and measures the time for returning echoes.
2. ESP32 calculates the distance using that duration.
3. If an object is detected within a set range (<20 cm), the servo rotates to open the dustbin lid.
4. After a fixed delay, the lid returns to its closed position.
5. The system continuously monitors for new objects.

This ensures a clean, hygienic, fully automatic waste-disposal process.

## 6. MicroPython Code (main.py)

```python
from machine import Pin, PWM
import time

TRIG = Pin(5, Pin.OUT)
ECHO = Pin(18, Pin.IN)
servo = PWM(Pin(13), freq=50)

def servo_write(angle):
    duty = int((angle / 180) * 75) + 40
    servo.duty(duty)

def get_distance():
    TRIG.off()
    time.sleep_us(2)
    TRIG.on()
    time.sleep_us(10)
    TRIG.off()

    while ECHO.value() == 0:
        pass
    start = time.ticks_us()

    while ECHO.value() == 1:
        pass
    end = time.ticks_us()

    duration = end - start
    return (duration * 0.034) / 2

servo_write(0)

while True:
    dist = get_distance()
    print("Distance:", dist, "cm")

    if dist > 0 and dist < 20:
        servo_write(90)
        time.sleep(3)
        servo_write(0)

    time.sleep(0.2)
```
