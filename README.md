#  Embedded Projects Collection

Welcome to my **Embedded Projects Repository** — a creative space featuring a variety of **mini embedded system projects** built using **Raspberry Pi Pico**, **STM32**, and **Arduino** microcontrollers.

This collection showcases how **hardware and code** come together to bring real-world ideas to life — using sensors, actuators, and logical design to create smart and interactive systems.
