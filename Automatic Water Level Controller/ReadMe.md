## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- MicroPython firmware on Raspberry Pi Pico
- Required libraries: `lcd_api.py`, `i2c_lcd.py`
- Thonny IDE or similar MicroPython environment

### Wiring Instructions
1. Connect ultrasonic sensor to GP2 and GP3
2. Wire LCD display using I2C (GP0, GP1)
3. Connect relay to GP15 with LED indicator
4. Install slide switch on GP14 with pull-down resistor
5. Ensure proper power supply to all components

## 🔄 Working Principle

### 🤖 Automatic Mode Operation
1. **Low Water Level** (< 100 cm): Motor turns ON automatically
2. **High Water Level** (> 300 cm): Motor turns OFF automatically  
3. **Intermediate Level**: Maintains current state (hysteresis)

### 👨‍💼 Manual Mode
- Slide switch override forces motor ON regardless of water level
- System returns to automatic mode when switch is turned off

### 📊 Real-time Monitoring
- Continuous distance measurement
- Live status display on LCD
- Visual feedback through LED


## 🏗 Hardware Assembly Guide

### Step-by-Step Construction
1. **Mount Components**: Secure all components on breadboard
2. **Power Connections**: Connect 5V and GND rails properly
3. **Sensor Placement**: Position ultrasonic sensor above tank
4. **Motor Connection**: Connect relay to pump motor circuit
5. **Testing**: Verify all connections before powering

### 🔍 Safety Considerations
